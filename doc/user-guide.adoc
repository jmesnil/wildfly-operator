= WildFly Operator - User Documentation
:toc:               left

This guide documents the various features and capabilites provides by the WildFly Operator.

This guide is complemented by the link:../apis.adoc[API Documentation].

[[basic-install]]
# Basic Install (Phase I)

The features and capabilities of **Basic Install (Phase I)** deals with the provisioning, installation and configuration of a Java application managed by the WildFly Operator.

[[application-image]]
## Specify the Docker Application Image

The `applicationImage` specifies the Docker application image that contains the Java application. The image must have been built 
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i[WildFly S2I].

[source,yaml]
.Example of application image configuration
----
spec:
  applicationImage: "quay.io/wildfly-quickstarts/wildfly-operator-quickstart:17.0"
----

The `applicationImage` accepts different references to Docker image:

* the name of the image: `quay.io/wildfly-quickstarts/wildfly-operator-quickstart`
* a tag: `quay.io/wildfly-quickstarts/wildfly-operator-quickstart:17.0`
* a digest: `quay.io/wildfly-quickstarts/wildfly-operator-quickstart@sha256:0af38bc38be93116b6a1d86a9c78bd14cd527121970899d719baf78e5dc7bfd2`

[[size]]
## Specify the Size of the Application

The `replicas` specifies the size of the application, i.e. the number of pods that runs the application image.

[source,yaml]
.Example of size configuration
----
spec:
  replicas:2
----

[[storage]]
## Specify the Storage Requirements for the Server Data Directory

The `storage` defines the storage requirements for the application data.
The application may require persistent storage for some data (e.g. transaction or messaging logs) that must persist across Pod restarts.

If the `storage` spec is empty, an `EmptyDir` volume will be used by each pod of the application (but this volume will not persist after its corresponding pod is stopped)
The `storage` spec is defined in the link:../apis.adoc#StorageSpec[StorageSpec API Documentation]

[source,yaml]
.Example of storage requirement
----
spec:
  storage:
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      spec:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 3Gi
----

The persistent volume that meets this storage requirement is mounted on the `/wildfly/standalone/data` directory (corresponding to WildFly's `jboss.server.data.dir` path).

[[env]]
## Configure the Application Environment

Environment can be configured using the `env` spec.
Environment variables can come directly from values (such as the `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST` example below) or from secrets (e.g. the `POSTGRESQL_USER` example below).

[source,yaml]
.Example of environment configuration
----
spec:
  env:
  - name: POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST
    value: postgresql
  - name: POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT
    value: '5432'
  - name: POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        key: database-name
        name: postgresql
  - name: POSTGRESQL_USER
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        key: database-user
        name: postgresql
  - name: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        key: database-password
        name: postgresql
----

[[standalone-config-map]]
## Bring Your Own Standalone XML Configuation

It is possible to directly provide WildFly standalone configuration instead of the one in the application image (that comes from WildFly S2I).

The standalone XML file must be put in a ConfigMap that is accessible by the operator.
The `standaloneConfigMap` must provide the `name` of this ConfigMap as well as the `key` corresponding to the name of standalone XML file.

[source,yaml]
.Example of bringing its own standalone configuration
----
spec:
  standaloneConfigMap:
    name: clusterbench-config-map
    key: standalone-openshift.xml
----

In this example, the `clusterbench-config-map` must be created *before* the WildFly Operator deploys the application.

[source,shell]
.Example of reating a ConfigMap from a standalone XML file
----
$ kubectl create configmap clusterbench-config-map --from-file examples/clustering/config/standalone-openshift.xml
configmap/clusterbench-config-map created
----

## OpenShift Features

Some Operator features are only available when running on OpenShift if Kubernetes does not provide the required resources to activate these features.

[[http-route-creation]]
### Creation of an HTTP Route

By default, when the Operator runs on OpenShift, it creates an external route to the HTTP port of the Java application.

This route creation can be disabled by setting `disableHTTPRoute` to `true` if you do not wish to create an external route to the Java application.

[source,yaml]
.Example to disable HTTP route
----
spec:
  disableHTTPRoute: true
----
